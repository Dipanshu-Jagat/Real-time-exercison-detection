# Real-time-exercison-detection using Mediapipe

## Introduction 

We propose a system that is capable detecting exercise in real time 

## Bicep Curl Counter

A bicep curl counter is designed to track and count the number of bicep curls performed during a workout. It is commonly used by individuals engaged in strength training or fitness routines to monitor their exercise progress and ensure consistent and effective training sessions.

Here we use mediapipe to calculate the angle between our joints and to perform the bicep curl , a counter is there that keep track of position and number of curls done correctly

## Push up counter

A push-up counter using Mediapipe is a real-time application that utilizes the Mediapipe library to track and count push-up repetitions during a workout. Mediapipe is an open-source framework that offers various pre-trained models for pose estimation and tracking of human body movements, making it ideal for exercise counting applications like push-ups.

When using Mediapipe for push-up counting, the application typically accesses the camera feed or video stream to analyze the user's body movements. By recognizing specific key points on the user's body, such as the hands and shoulders, the application can identify the correct push-up form and accurately count each repetition.

As the user performs a push-up, the Mediapipe-based counter will detect the downward and upward phases of the exercise and increment the count accordingly. The real-time feedback allows the user to monitor their progress and maintain proper form throughout the workout.
